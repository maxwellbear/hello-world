# hello-world
first repo how does this coding thing work
  I'm just teaching myself coding, after spending time learning myofascial pathologies and learning how the world works. I'm 46 and feel like my life just began!
  I want to make human protection and exercise technologies. This includes bandages, sports armour, tactical suits, better crash protection for vehicles and a better (cyclist's version) Peloton-style exercise bike .  I've had a fairly interesting life having lived in BC, Canada and Hawaii over the last 20 years.  I have worked as a bicycle messenger,construction labourer, Weldor, hole digger, Rolfer (bodyworker) and have experience with landscaping and plumbing work as well.  I am interested in such things as architecture, city planning and geology
  I'm excitied to get back to computers and an open-sourced world. I am currently at langara, and I'm heading to UBC as soon as possible.  I'm really excited to go to school and that I've figured out how things work in this world we're on so I can progress my own skills and knowledge.
